# \#StepTrackerLog



This is a C++ Step Tracking and Idea Log program created for ITCS 2550.



The program allows users to log walking sessions by entering steps taken, time walked, and ideas or reminders thought of during the walk. It calculates steps per minute, displays formatted output in the console, and saves a report to a file.

## OOP Design (Week 04)

This project now uses:
- Inheritance (Activity → WalkActivity, RunActivity)
- Composition (Metrics class)
- Overridden print() functions
- Protected base members

A class diagram is included showing these relationships.
